export const aboutMe = `Hello, I’m Lucky Kumari, a software engineer who graduated in 2024
            with a strong foundation in Computer Science Engineering. I
            completed my B.Tech at Shershah Engineering College, Sasaram, Bihar,
            and hold a diploma from Government Polytechnic College, Bihar. I’ve
            gained hands-on experience in building scalable web applications
            using Java, Spring Boot, JSP, Servlets, and PostgreSQL. I’ve also
            worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive UI frameworks.
            During my internship and training at MountBlue Technologies and
            Hexile Pvt Ltd, I built full-stack applications and developed skills
            in REST APIs, authentication, and database management. I’m
            enthusiastic about continuous learning and applying my technical
            expertise to solve real-world problems.`;

export const footerAbout = `I'm a dedicated software developer skilled in Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL,
            and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m passionate
